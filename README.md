# WordPress portfolio

I created a new mock portfolio using Wordpress, PHP, and Sass. This is based on a PHP course I completed. Please note, this site is not currently hosted online.

1. Set up a local development environment:
   Ensure you have Local by Flywheel installed on your system.
   Create a new project in Local by Flywheel, configuring it to use the appropriate settings for your development environment.

2. Configure the project:
   Import the cloned WordPress files into your Local by Flywheel project.
   Set up the necessary database and environment configurations.

3. Run the project:
   Start your Local by Flywheel project, which will launch the WordPress site on your local environment.
